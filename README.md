## If you want to understand or learn how our devices collect data:

[Click here](https://github.com/aiotgroup/XRF55-repo/tree/main/hardware%20tutorial) for an explanation of how the WiFi, mmWave, RFID, and Kinect devices are initialized, data collected, and processed for the device.

## If you want to download our video dataset but have questions about it:

[readme_for_video_users.md](https://github.com/aiotgroup/XRF55-repo/blob/main/readme_for_video_users.md) will help you to process the downloaded XRF55 video dataset correctly!

## If you want to reproduce our experiments:

### Prerequisites

- Linux
- Python 3.7
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

### Getting Started

#### Installation

- Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aiotgroup/XRF55-repo.git
cd XRF55-repo
```

- Install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org) and other dependencies (e.g., torchvision, torch, numpy).
  - For pip users, please type the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - For Conda users, you can create a new Conda environment using `conda env create -f environment.yml`.

#### XRF train/test

- Download [XRF dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/xrfdataset/xrf55):
  - Download the `dataset.zip`, unzip it and move it to `./dataset/Raw_dataset/`

- Split train/test data:
(Used only for split train and test sets, you can rewrite the script to meet different needs)
```
python split_train_test.py 
```

- Generate label file:

```
python generate_txt.py 
```

- Train a model:

```bash
python dml_train.py 
```

- Test the model:

```bash
python dml_eval.py 
```
